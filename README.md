# Machine-Learning-approach-to-fake-news-detection
This is the repository for the CMPE 255 Project on using machine learning models for fake news detection.

**There are three files in the src folder:**

- most_common_Words_visualization.ipynb

  - This contains the code used to plot Figure 1.

- Visualization.ipynb

  - This contains the file where the remaining figures for the preprocessing and results were formed

- Pipeline_and_Model.ipynb

  - This contains the files where the code for the model processing is kept. The final model is run separately as it was decided on at a later point in comparison to the other three.

  

**There is 1 file in the data folder:**

- edditeddata.csv.
  - This contains the data frame after cleanup and preprocessing instead of the original format in which it was saved.
