# Machine-Learning-approach-to-fake-news-detection
This is the repository for the CMPE 255 Project on using machine learning models for fake news detection.

**There are three files in the src folder which were utilized in the final project:**

- most_common_Words_visualization.ipynb
  - This contains the code used to plot Figure 1.
- Visualization.ipynb
  - This contains the file where the remaining figures for the preprocessing and results were formed
- Pipeline_and_Model.ipynb
  - This contains the files where the code for the model processing is kept. The final model is run separately as it was decided on at a later point in comparison to the other three.

Each of the Jupiter notebooks do not require anything to be run  except having the required libraries installed. The Initial pipeline_and_Model file needs to be run first to allow for the formation of the edited data document which is used for visualization and the 6 CSV files from which the data is extracted for the graphs of the results. 

**The dataset can be obtained from the following link:**  https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
